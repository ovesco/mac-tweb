# File sharing collaboration system

> This project was made in the scope of the MAC-TWEB project of the HEIG-VD

This project is a small social network oriented around file sharing and allows
its user to publish, share, save and visualise files. People can tag their files
to make them easily searchable, and when they see a cool file, they can like it
or comment the corresponding activity.

If you want to learn more you can check the documentation file in this repository (in french).
